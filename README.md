## Course Registration System

This is a **Course Registration System** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets students browse available courses, register or drop courses, and view their current schedule in a clean, responsive interface.

### Features
- **Course browsing** with search and filters
- **Student registration** and course selection
- **Prerequisite and capacity checks** (as defined in the logic)
- **Persistent data** using structured JSON sample data
- **Responsive design** so it works on desktop and mobile

### Project Structure

- `style.css` – layout and styling  
- `script.js` – core logic and event handling
